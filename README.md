# URSorterJS

## TODO :

- Finish transition between Python to JS
- Cleanup existing code
- Full JSON handling as args - See how mocks data can also be passed as JSON, as bosses data at the moment, SheetParser file should then be removed
- Hit route - Check for the lowest possible oneshot if any
- Rework everything for new UR rules - no forced boss order
